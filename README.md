# python-snippets

Snippets of Python sample code I've created during my Dev life.

## Getting Started

Each folder contains one or more different snippets, meant for a lot of different stuff.
Feel free to grab them and use them in your works.

* [AWS](./aws)
* [Databases](./dbs)
* [Date/Datetime](./datetime)
* [Files](./files)
* [Spark](./spark)

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.6
* If required, the script will contain a comment section for required python packages.

### Installing

You can download each file manually or clone the whole repo and start browsing the snippets in your machine.

## Contributing

You can feel free to open PRs to modify my code or to add new snippets, I'll analyse all of them. 

## Versioning

I currently use only Git to version.
I'll use mostly the `master` branch 'cause I only post functional snippets i've already used in real life projects.
